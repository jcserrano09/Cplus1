Description: 1)Write a program that shows as many different words as you can think of that can be formed using only the letters in "crate." Each word should appear on a separate line. Letters may be used only as many times as they appear in "crate."
Example: If the letters had been "mat," I could form the words a, am, at, mat and tam. Each of those words would appear on a separate line.

2)Write a program that draws a picture of a spaceship, using only cout << statements. */
